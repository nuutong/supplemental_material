# supplemental_material
Experimental data and reproducibility instructions

### File List 
	~/benchmarks/: the directory of benchmarks whice we use to evaluate our tool
	~/install.sh : the executable script to configure environmnet and install tool requiled
	~/statistics/: the directory containing code to analyse data
	~/aaltaf/: the directory containing the source code of our tool, i.e., AALTAF
	~/README: this README file
	~/experiments-prepared/: the experimental data run by us, and can be checked immediately without re-running the experiments
	~/result: the directory containing graphs used in our paper

### Configuration and Installation 
Instruction to configure environmnet and install tool requiled:
1. Open the terminal, ctrl+alt+T or just open it from left menu
2. Change directory to supplemental_material/ in the terminal
3. Run the script install.sh, execute:
   ```
	 chmod +x install.sh
	 sudo ./install.sh
   ```
4. Test AALTAF, run following commands in terminal:

	`./aaltaf 'a & !a'`
  
You will see some output starting with "MUC", if you install AALTAF successfully.
Note that the entered formula should be unsatisfiable, otherwise there will be errors.

### Reproduce Experimental Results
To speed up the experiment, we conducted experiments on a local server, the experimental data we obtained are in ~/experiments-prepared/statistics.  

  ```
  cd ~/experiments-prepared  
  chmod +x reproduce.sh    
  sudo ./reproduce.sh  
  ```    
You can see the newly generated experimental statistical graphs in the ~/experiments-prepared/statistics/result directory


### Usage for AALTAF
After you compile AALTAF successfully, the executable file is in the directory, i.e., supplemental_material/aaltaf/aaltaf.  
Therefore, if you want to use aaltaf, you can specify the executable file by file path in command line, or you can update environment variable:

`export PATH=$PATH:/home/supplemental_material/aaltaf/`

To run the aaltaf:
1. Open the terminal, ctrl+alt+T or just open it from left menu  
2. Change directory to supplemental_material/aaltaf in the terminal  
3. Execute:  

	`./aaltaf -h`  

    informaton about usage:
    ```
    usage: ./aalta_f [-e|-v|-blsc|-t|-h|-naive|-naive-uc|-binary|-binary-uc|-global] ["formula"]
	 -e	:	 print example when result is SAT
	 -v	:	 print verbose details
	 -blsc	:	 use the BLSC checking method; Default is CDLSC
	 -t	:	 print weak until formula
	 -h	:	 print help information
	 -c	:	 open the Correctness Check
	 -naive	:	 use the NAIVE approach to obtain MUC
	 -naive-uc:	 use the NAIVE+UC approach to obtain MUC
	 -binary	:	 use the BINARY approach to obtain MUC
	 -binary-uc:	 use the BINARY+UC approach to obtain MUC
	 -global	:	 use the GLOBAL approach to obtain MUC
   ```
Note that if you only enter the `./aaltaf` command, the BINARY method will be used by default

4. Run some examples:
    excute example:
    
 	  `./aaltaf  'a & !a'` 
  
    You can also just enter `./aaltaf` command, and then enter the formula after the 'please input the formula:' appears
    For longer formulas, we recommend to directly enter the file path to execute, otherwise there may be a syntax error: 
    
    `./aaltaf <'../benchmarks/general/spec_cl_18.alaska' `  
      
    if you want to use BINARY+UC approach, try to execute:  
    
    `./aaltaf -binary-uc <'../benchmarks/general/spec_cl_18.alaska' ` 
        

### Correctness Check
We have checked the correctness of the MUC obtained by each formula in the benchmarks.  
If you want to check the correctness, try to execute:  

`./aaltaf -c `  
  
You can use this command in combination with method commandsï¼š

`./aaltaf -c -global 'a & !a'`  
  
The terminal will output "MUC is right" if the obtained MUC is correct.
